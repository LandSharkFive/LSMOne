Improvements

1.  (Easy)  Add code for Distinct() to the merge.  Distinct() removes duplicates by checking for equality between
    the current item and the last item.

2.  (Easy) Add schema to the data tables.  A schema is a JSON file that contains columns.  Each column has
    a column name and column type.

3.  (Medium) Implement a skip list for the memtable.

4.  (Easy) Add code to save the memtable (skip list) when it reaches a size limit.  The data is written
    to a data file.  The memtable is cleared.

5.  (Hard) Create a class that encapsulates the memtable and the datafiles.  The class can search for
    values and save values.  

6.  (Hard) Add a Write Ahead Log (WAL), so that data isn't lost during a power failure.
