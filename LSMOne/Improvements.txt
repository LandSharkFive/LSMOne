Improvements

1.  (Easy)  Add code for Distinct() to the merge.  Distinct remove duplicates by checking equality between
    the current item and the last item.

2.  (Easy) Add schema to the data tables.  A schema consists of a JSON file that contains columns.  Each column has
    a column name and column type.

3.  (Medium) Implement a skip list for the memtable.

4.  (Easy) Add code to save the memtable (skip list) when it reaches a size limit.  The data is written
    to a data file and the memtable is cleared.

5.  (Hard) Create an object (class) which encapsulates both the memtable and the datafiles.  It allows searching for
    values and saving values.  

6.  (Hard) Add a Write Ahead Log (WAL), so that data cannot be lost during a power failure.
